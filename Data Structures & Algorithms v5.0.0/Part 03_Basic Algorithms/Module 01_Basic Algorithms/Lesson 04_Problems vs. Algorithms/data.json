All solutions should be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed. \n* In the respective  \"problem_1.py\" files, **include at least 3 test cases for each solution.**\n * For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console\".\n * On the next line, **comment out the output you expect to see from that function call.** At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, et cetera.\n* **Write up an explanation for each question** in a single separate text file, PDF or markdown called \"explanation_1.md\".\n * Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.\n* Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.\n\n> Please take care to complete these requirements when submitting! If for any reason we are unable to review your submission, we will let you know promptly so you may resubmit. Resubmitting will start a new window for feedback delivery.\n\n#### Want to check your answers before asking for feedback?\n* Compare your answers to the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2498/view).\n\n## What's Next?\nOnce submitted, an industry professional will provide you with personalized, written feedback based on the [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2498/view).\n\nThe review will be complete once you have received this feedback.",

The questions cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.\n\nA qualified reviewer, such as a software or data engineer, will look over your answer and give you detailed, written feedback on areas you're doing very well in and areas that could be improved. For example, is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?\n\nFeel free to write this code in your local development environment. In case you do not have the ability to use your local environment or wish to use the classroom to write your code a Jupyter notebook is provided below. \n",

Instead of simple words the Trie will contain a part of the http path at each node, building from the root node `/`\n\nIn addition to a path though, we need to know which function will handle the http request.   In a real router we would probably pass an instance of a class like Python's [SimpleHTTPRequestHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler) which would be responsible for handling requests to that path.   For the sake of simplicity we will just use a string that we can print out to ensure we got the right _handler_\n\nWe could split the path into letters similar to how we did the autocomplete Trie, but this would result in a Trie with a very large number of nodes and lengthy traversals if we have a lot of pages on our site.   A more sensible way to split things would be on the parts of the path that are separated by slashes (\"/\").   A Trie with a single path entry of: \"/about/me\" would look like:\n\n(root, None) -> (\"about\", None) -> (\"me\", \"About Me handler\")\n\nWe can also simplify our RouteTrie a bit by excluding the suffixes method and the endOfWord property on RouteTrieNodes.  We really just need to insert and find nodes, and if a RouteTrieNode is not a leaf node, it won't have a handler which is fine.",
