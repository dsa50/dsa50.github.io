00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, I'm back again.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.905
Just wanted to stress the importance of the material you're about to learn.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.900
Using a data structure that employs

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.500
a hash function allows you to do look ups in constant time.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.595
Let that sink in for a second.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:15.610
With everything you've learned so far,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.770
you need to do look ups in linear time.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.765
In a list or a set,

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:23.125
you need to look through every element to find the one you're looking for.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:27.835
Stacks and queues let you look up the oldest or newest elements immediately,

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:32.080
and priority queues will let you find the highest priority element quickly.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.120
But if you want any other element,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.445
you've got to do a linear time search.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:39.280
The ability to do constant time look ups will make

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540
almost any algorithm you write instantly faster.
