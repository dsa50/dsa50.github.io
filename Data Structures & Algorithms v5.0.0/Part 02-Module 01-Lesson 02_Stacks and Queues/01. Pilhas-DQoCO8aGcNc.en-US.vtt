00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.600
Literally every time
I hear about stacks,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.470
I can only think about a stack of
pancakes, chocolate chip, of course.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.680
Or maybe I'm just always
thinking about pancakes?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.350
Not actually sure.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.820
Stacks are also list-based
data structures, so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.500
they have a bit of a different
flair than arrays and linked lists.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.470
The main idea is a stack is like
a stack of objects in real life.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.599
You keep putting elements on top and
you have easy access to remove or

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.590
look at the top element.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.840
Even if the pancake on the bottom looks
like it has the most chocolate chips

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630
I can't get to it easily.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.390
I need to make my way through
everything above it to reach it.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
I also know that it was the earliest
thing put on the stack,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.400
back when I thought I would
have chocolate chips to spare.
