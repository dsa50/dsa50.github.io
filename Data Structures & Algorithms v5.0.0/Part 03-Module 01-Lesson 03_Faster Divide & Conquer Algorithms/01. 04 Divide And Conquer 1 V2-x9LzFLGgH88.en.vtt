00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Divide and conquer algorithms or recursive algorithms,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.015
is one of the first algorithmic tools that many of you may have learned.

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:08.580
For example, binary search or merge sort.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.560
To see the power of divide and conquer,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.195
we'll look at a fundamental problem.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.405
Given N numbers, we'd like to find the median element.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:16.829
The numbers are unsorted,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.389
so they are in arbitrary order.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.300
Can we find the median without first sorting the list?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.320
We'll look at a really ingenious divide and conquer algorithm to do just that.
