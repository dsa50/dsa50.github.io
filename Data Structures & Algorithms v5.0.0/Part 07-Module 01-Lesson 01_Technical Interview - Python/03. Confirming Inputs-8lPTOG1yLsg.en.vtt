00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.130
So I'm taking in a matrix
containing only 0s and 1s.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.795
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:14.400
And what I'm returning is
an integer that represents

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700
the number of violence in our matrix.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.261
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.134
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's perfect really clear.

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:21.919
&gt;&gt; All right thanks.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.540
&gt;&gt; So that was a short but
important portion of the interview.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.930
Can you tell me what
the gentleman was doing?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.950
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like he's confirming
the signature of the algorithm

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.280
he would be writing.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.990
This step is important because now he
knows what's given in the problem.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.350
And what the result needs to be.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.600
This is going to be really useful
information once we get into

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.330
the next step.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.190
In a way,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.900
he's also confirming the question again
to make sure he's on the right track.
