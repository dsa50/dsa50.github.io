00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.905
Okay, so we can also take in
an input of a non object and

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.575
maybe even an empty matrix.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.190
Is that right?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.979
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:14.400
&gt;&gt; Hm, so we have our regular matrix so
that we're taking in,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
but it contains zeroes and
ones, nothing else, right?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.920
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.915
&gt;&gt; So this is also another
input that we can have.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.490
So here we started thinking
through tests and edge cases for

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.240
inputs into the algorithm.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.389
As you may have noticed,
when he was creating edge cases,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.770
he thought of the possible weird
inputs that he would have to handle.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.730
&gt;&gt; Right, if there were other values
that could have been used in his matrix,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.819
he would have to account for those.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.201
It's always a good idea to think
about how your code handles null and

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:45.900
empty inputs, since not addressing
them could cause your code to crash.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.765
&gt;&gt; You know what is great about
this step in the approach,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:51.334
is I have a feeling it
might help in future steps.

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.910
&gt;&gt; Let's see.
