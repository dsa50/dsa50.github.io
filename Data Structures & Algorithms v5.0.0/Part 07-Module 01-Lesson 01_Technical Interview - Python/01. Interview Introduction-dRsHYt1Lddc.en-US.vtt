00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Now that you understand algorithms and
data structures,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
it's time to think about
the actual interview.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
For this lesson,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
we're joined by a very special
guest to help us to do just that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.754
Welcome, Horatio.

00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:04.438
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Horatio, and
I'm an Android coach here at Udacity.

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:05.259
Not too long ago,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.039
I was in a similar situation to
the one you may be in right now.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.109
I never took a class in college about
data structures and algorithms.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.579
But I just graduated from
a UDacity Nanodegree, was preparing for

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.348
technical interviews.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.629
Learning about data structures and

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.329
algorithms made me feel more
confident about technical interviews.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.179
But I soon realized what is also very
important is the actual process for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.796
answering an algorithm
question in an interview.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:29.839
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.739
When an interviewer asks you a question,
your ability to get the right answer is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.383
just a small part of
what they're evaluating.

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:39.508
They also want to see your
approach to solving problems and

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:41.114
your communication skills.

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:43.349
&gt;&gt; In this lesson,
you'll be shown interviews, and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.626
then we'll break them down at each step
to help you understand exactly what

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:49.319
the interviewee is doing right and
wrong.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.179
Then you will be able to implement
the interviewees' skills while avoiding

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.599
their mistakes.

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:58.169
&gt;&gt; The path to a successful algorithm's
interview involves a seven-step process,

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:01.439
which we'll go over in further
detail throughout the lesson.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:06.544
&gt;&gt; The steps are Clarifying the
Question, Generating Inputs and Outputs,

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:12.729
Generating Test Cases, Brainstorming,
Runtime Analysis, Coding, and Debugging.

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.819
So let's get right into
it with our interview.
