00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
So now let's add the getter and setters for the children.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.995
We'll go ahead and use what we've already created for the node.

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:12.515
We want to define set_left_child,

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:14.165
and I'll fix these later.

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:15.380
Just setting it up.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.400
Set_right_child, get_left_child and get right child.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.960
So now we have these functions defined and let's go ahead and fix these.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.495
We want to set, the left child.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:34.970
It's going to be taking in some node that it will set it to and it's going to set

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.790
the left self.left equal to that node that's passed in.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.890
Similarly, for set_right_child, it's going to take in some node and

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.095
then it's going to set the right node pointer to that node.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.270
Now, to get the left child,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.005
we can just return self.left.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.820
Similarly. For the right child,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.450
we're going to return self.right.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.105
Awesome. Let's check if it works.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.045
So here we can check by creating three nodes.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.830
There's going to be node0, node1,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.215
and node2, they store value;

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:14.865
apple, banana, and orange.

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:19.350
Now, for node0, I will set this left child to node0,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.815
which is banana, and node0's right child,

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.985
I will set to node2, which is orange.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.835
We'll just print it out to see if it works, and indeed,

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:34.630
node0's left child is banana and node0's right child is orange.
