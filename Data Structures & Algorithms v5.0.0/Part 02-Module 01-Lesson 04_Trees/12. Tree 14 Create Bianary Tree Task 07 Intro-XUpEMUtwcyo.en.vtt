00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Now let's modify the tree constructor,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.000
so that it takes an input that initializes the root node.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.750
So you can choose between two options, when you think about it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.830
The constructor can either take a Node object or the constructor

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.795
takes a value and then creates a new node that stores that value.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.870
So you can think about it, try both, possibly,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.170
and then we can go over the solution and discuss which one might be better.
