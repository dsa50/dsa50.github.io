If there's one thing that you
take away from this course,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.609
it should be that data structures
have rather uncreative names.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.860
Trees are data structures that,
well, look like trees.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.230
A tree starts from a place called a root
and you add data to it called branches.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000
A big tree will fan out with lots of
different branches in lots of different

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.640
directions, just like a real tree.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.190
There are plenty of other tree terms
related to these data structures.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.860
They have leaves, a collection of
trees is called a forest, etc.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.630
Try to keep a straight face as we dive
in and see what trees are all about.
