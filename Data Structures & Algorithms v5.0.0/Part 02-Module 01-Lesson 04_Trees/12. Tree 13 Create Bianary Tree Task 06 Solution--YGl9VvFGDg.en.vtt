00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Now we're going to define the tree class.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:08.770
So you can start with pseudocode and just think that a tree contains a root node,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.885
and we'll also have a function that's going to get that root node.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.865
But now let's write it in Python.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:18.435
So we have a class tree, inherits from object,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.330
and let's define the constructor,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.770
and then it's going to set the root node is equal to none.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.205
Then let's define the get_root method that's going to return the root.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:34.660
All right, there you go.
