00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
So now we're going to learn how to code up a binary tree from scratch.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.640
So first you'll want to build a node class.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.790
I would recommend, if you haven't done this in a while,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.205
then first draw it on a piece of paper,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.200
how a tree looks like, something like this.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.030
Then, think about what are the attributes that a particular node needs to store.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.520
A hint is there's going to be three things.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.250
So instructions are defined a class node,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.860
and define a constructor that takes no arguments,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.395
and sets the three instance variables to none.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:36.460
So go ahead and try it out and then check out the solution.
