00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
So your next task is to check if the left or right child already exists.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
In other words, if it's already been set to some node and it's not just none,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.130
so to find that has left child and it has right child.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.560
So that they return true if the node has a left child or a right child,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.210
respectively, you can go ahead and reuse the code

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.910
you created earlier and just add these two functions.
