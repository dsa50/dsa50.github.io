00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Now, our next task is to create a tree class.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.775
So create a class called Tree that has a root instance variable of type Node.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.975
Also define a get_root method that returns the root node.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.210
So visually, what I mean is this.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.685
A tree is a collection of nodes.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.190
We've already been defining the node class.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.685
The tree will just need to point to one node,

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.455
which is the one at the very top,

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.335
because from there, the root node,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:29.925
we can access all the other nodes.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.010
So here, just create a new class.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.000
We're not copying over the node class anymore.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.450
Create the tree class,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
and then you can check your solution in the next video.
