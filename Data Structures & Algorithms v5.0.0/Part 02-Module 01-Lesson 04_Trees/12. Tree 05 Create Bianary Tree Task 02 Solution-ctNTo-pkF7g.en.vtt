00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
Now let's go ahead and reuse the code we already generated.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.160
Then modify the constructor so that it takes in a value.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.740
So now it takes in a value, but also,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.965
in case it doesn't, we just want to give a default value of none.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:19.970
Then we want to set that value to our node's value here.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.580
So let's check if this works.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
We'll create a node with no value entered and it should work.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
Also, we'll create a node that takes in a value,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.295
and that should also work.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:37.275
As you can see, this node prints out,

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:41.230
this node also prints out with this stored value, apple.
