00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
So next, we just want to modify the constructors so that it takes a value as a parameter.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.870
So you can copy what you just made and modify

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.165
the constructor so it takes an optional value,

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.895
which assigns it to the node's value.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.355
Otherwise, it will set the node's value to none.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.840
Go ahead and try this out.
