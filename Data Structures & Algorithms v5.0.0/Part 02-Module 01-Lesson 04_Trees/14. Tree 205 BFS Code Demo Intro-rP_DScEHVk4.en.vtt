00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
So now that we have a queue,

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:07.935
let's write some code step by step to try to mimic what we did conceptually.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.035
First, to keep track of our visiting,

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.990
let's create a list and we'll also use a queue.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.585
So we're using this queue that I just created and we're going to start with the root.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.950
We're going to start with the apple and we're going to enqueue it, add it to the queue.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.130
So now we see that the queue has apple.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.725
Then we're going to dequeue the next node in the queue,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.380
which is apple, then we're going to visit it.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
So we visited apple and then we're going to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.050
check if it has a left child then add it to the queue,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.755
if it has a right child add it to the queue.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.445
As we can see here,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.065
we've visited apple and now banana,

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:49.880
the left child, is on the queue followed by cherry.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.650
So now we're going to dequeue from this queue and next in line is banana.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.560
So we're going to visit banana.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.470
So dequeue banana visit it and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.640
then check if it has a left child if so add it to the queue,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.320
check if it has a right child,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.880
if so add it to the queue.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020
So as you can see, we did enqueued dates because it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.320
the left child of banana and we've now have visited apple followed by banana.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.220
So now we're going to dequeue the next node,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.260
next in line is cherry.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.575
So here we get cherry, we visit cherry.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:26.625
If it has left or right children add it.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:32.480
In this case it doesn't and so we can see here we still have dates in the queue.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.285
So we're going to dequeue dates,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.225
we're going to visit dates,

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:40.020
check if it has left or right children in this case it doesn't,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.280
and then we can see here we now visited apple,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.275
banana, then cherry then dates and also the queue is empty.

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.810
So now your task is to write this in code.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.060
As you can tell, we repeated a lot of this,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.480
so you can imagine you'll be using a for loop. All right, good luck.
