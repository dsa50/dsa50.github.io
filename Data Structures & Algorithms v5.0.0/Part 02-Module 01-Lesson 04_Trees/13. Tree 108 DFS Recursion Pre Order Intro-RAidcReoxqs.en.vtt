00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
So now let's take advantage of recursion,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.105
which is behind the scenes using a stack

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:10.380
and we'll use that to implement the pre-order traversal of the tree.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.675
So go ahead and implement this function.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.675
Remember in general, when you have recursion,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.590
you will have some function that's initializing some things and then it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.185
starts the recursive process by calling another function that is the recursive call.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.260
So what I mean is in general,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.975
what you would see with recursion is you have

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:35.520
an initializing function and then it calls something like int,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.835
int traverse and then within traverse,

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:43.315
it's calling traverse somehow differently.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:48.210
So go ahead and try this out and then you can check this solution next.
