00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.715
Now, we're going to define insertion in code.

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:06.465
One way to do this is with a loop,

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.005
and another way to do insertion is with recursion.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.745
So you can try one or the other,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.290
or both, and when you're done,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.320
you can see if it works by inserting a couple of nodes and checking what it looks like.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.320
Once you've tried this out, go ahead and check out the solution.
