00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.335
Now let's set up a tree that we can traverse using breadth first search.

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:06.645
So we're going to create a tree that looks like this.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.960
The root is apple, and then there is banana, cherry, and dates.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.250
So similar to before,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.510
we're going to define a node class and a tree class.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.435
Then we'll create a tree and then we'll set the root nodes,

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.785
left child to banana,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.510
it's right child to cherry,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.440
and then we'll get banana's left child will be set to dates.
