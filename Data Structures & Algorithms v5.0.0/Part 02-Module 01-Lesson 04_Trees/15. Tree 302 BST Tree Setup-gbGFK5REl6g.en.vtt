00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
Now, let's set up this notebook so that we can implement some functions.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.755
First, we're going to define a node class,

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:09.015
which we've seen before.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.900
Also, just for the sake of a print function for the tree,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
we're also going to use a queue so that we can traverse it breadth first search.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.290
All right. Now, let's continue on with the lesson.
