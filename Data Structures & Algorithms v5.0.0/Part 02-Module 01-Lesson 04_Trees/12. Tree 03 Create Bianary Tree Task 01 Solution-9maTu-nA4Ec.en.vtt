00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
So now let's see how we would code up the node class.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:05.669
First, in some pseudocode,

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.150
you can think there is a node class and there are three things that I need in there.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.509
There's the value that is storing and also there's

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.934
pointers to the left child and the right child so that means there's a value.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.594
There is the left child and then there's the right child.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.759
Now, let's define this with better syntax.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.770
It's going to be a class node,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.989
it's going to inherit from object,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.480
and it mentions define a constructor.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.850
So here's the constructor,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.079
and it doesn't take any arguments, so just self.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.210
It's going to set these three values to none.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.170
Remember these are instance variables.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.740
So I'm saying self.view, self.left.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.150
So there you go, we haven't node and let's see if it works.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.669
So I checked that it got these three values.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.750
It looks like it's doing okay.
