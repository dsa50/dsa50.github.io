00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
Next, let's add some setters and getters for assigning left and right childs.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.205
So define a function, set_left_child,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:10.095
and a function, set_right_child.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:15.045
Each function takes in a node that it assigns as the left or right child, respectively.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.110
Now, that we can assume that this will replace an existing node if

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.285
it's already assigned as a left or right child.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.525
Also, define the get_left and get_right_child functions.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.920
One note for you is,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.110
you may wondering why you're starting from a blank cell every time.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.450
I think for coding interviews,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.310
it's good practice because you'll usually not be given any scaffolding code.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.285
You'll just be starting from a blank sheet of paper, not even a computer.

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:40.775
So I do encourage you to try this out,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:44.400
but don't worry I'll be coding a solutions with you.
