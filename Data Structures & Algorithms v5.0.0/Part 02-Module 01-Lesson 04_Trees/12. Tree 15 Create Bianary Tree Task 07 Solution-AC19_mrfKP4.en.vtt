00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.895
So let's try doing things both ways and discuss what we might think is better.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.525
So first, let's just take what we already have.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.780
Here, the first option is the constructor can

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.025
take a node itself and then set the root to that node.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:20.415
Another option, option 2,

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.230
it can take something that we assume is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.935
a value and then it'll create a new node based on that value,

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:28.020
and then set that to the root node.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.265
So when you think about end user using your tree class to store their data,

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:38.690
you could imagine that they probably don't really want to worry about what's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.510
internally inside your tree class and just be able to use it to put their data in there.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.825
So in that case, it probably would make more sense to

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.560
have the values that the function is taken,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.700
the parameters be the values that the user wants to store,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.890
instead of assuming that they know how to create

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.620
a new node class and then work with that.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.350
So I'd recommend writing it this way.
