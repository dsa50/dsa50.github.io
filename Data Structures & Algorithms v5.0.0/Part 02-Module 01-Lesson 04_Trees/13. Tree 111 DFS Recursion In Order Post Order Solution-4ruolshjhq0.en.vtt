00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Now let's define in-order traversal.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.980
It's quite similar to pre_order.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.250
So we can actually copy what we already did and then just modify it.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.025
So the difference is that we want to first traverse the left,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:19.455
and then we want to visit and then we want to traverse the right. So that's in_order.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.980
So we get dates, banana, apple, cherry.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.470
Then similarly for post_order,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.715
we can take what we already have which is quite similar, post_order.

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.830
So now if we post_order of what it is,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.585
is traverse left, then traverse right and then visit the node.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.670
So if we run that,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.500
we get dates, banana,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.190
cherry, apple. Awesome. Good job.
