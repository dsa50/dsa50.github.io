00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
As optional bonus task,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.205
try to write a print function that will show you

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.385
all the nodes in the tree and the structure.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:09.495
So here's the root,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.685
here is this left and right child,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:13.935
here's the left child of banana,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.095
the right child of bananas empty,

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.290
the left and right children of cherry are empty.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.640
Here node, dates has a left child.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.580
Node is empty right is empty as well.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240
The trick here is we're having

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.555
these empty placeholders so we can keep track of which node is a child of which parent.

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:41.480
So a hint I have is to use a variable to keep track of which level each node is on.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.580
So for instance, the root node is on level 0 and its child nodes are at level 1.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.005
So don't worry, this is optional,

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.790
but might be fun to try out.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.510
When you're done trying it,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.160
then go ahead and check the solution.
