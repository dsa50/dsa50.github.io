00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.225
Now let's go add setters and getters.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.910
Let's first go ahead and just reuse what we already did.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.190
We want a get_value.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.225
I'll fill this in too. We also want a set_value.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.550
So notice here, we want to set it to something,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.950
so it's going to also need to take in a value.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.635
So to get value, we can return,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.500
self.value, and to set the value,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.440
we can say self.value is equal to value
