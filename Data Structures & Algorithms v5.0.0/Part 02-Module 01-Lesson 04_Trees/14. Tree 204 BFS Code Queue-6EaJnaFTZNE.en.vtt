00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay, so now we're going to write some code.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.380
Remember, we want to do Breadth Research.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.990
So it's apple, banana, cherry, and dates.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.330
To do that, we want to implement a queue.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.125
So to do that, I'm going to actually import deck from collections,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.745
which is a double ended queue.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.815
I'm going to use the appendleft,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.330
and the pop functions of it to do enqueue and dequeue.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.370
So here's some examples of how this works.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.890
But to make it easier to work with,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.840
I'm just going to create my own class queue,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.775
and it will also use a deck.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.250
So when I enqueue, I'm going to use a pen left.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.590
When I dequeue, I'm going to use pop.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.895
But I just also want to double-check to make sure the queue isn't empty when I'm popping.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:43.135
This is to help me when I call print on my queue object,

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:46.165
that it will print out what's inside of the queue.

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:47.975
So if we run this,

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.135
we can go ahead and see.

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:52.385
If we create a queue object,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.635
we enqueue apple and banana and then cherry.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.305
We can see we have,

00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:58.175
apple was inserted first,

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:02.315
so it's next in line to be dequeued and then followed by banana and cherry.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:06.680
Okay, so we add items to the top here and we remove items at the bottom.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.914
Also, if we dequeue,

00:01:08.914 --> 00:01:11.510
notice we dequeue apple.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.050
Now the queue just has banana and cherry.
