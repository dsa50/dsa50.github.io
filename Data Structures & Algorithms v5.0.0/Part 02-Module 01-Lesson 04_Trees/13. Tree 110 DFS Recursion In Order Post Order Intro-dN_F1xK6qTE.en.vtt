00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Okay. Now the next two are going to be quite similar to what we already did.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.175
We're going to do in-order traversal.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.175
So that's means traverse the left subtree,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.450
then visit the node,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.250
and then traverse the right subtree.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.750
After you do that something also very similar is post-order traversal,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.865
which means traverse the left subtree,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.845
then traverse the right subtree,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.090
and then visit the node.
