00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
So now we're going to walk through some code in the Notebook that's

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.255
going to generate a sample tree that we can practice traversing.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:07.920
So it's going to look like this,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.300
is going to have apple at the root and then also banana, cherry, and dates.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.235
We're using a node class,

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.910
which we generated, we wrote the code for this in the previous exercise.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.850
All I'm doing is adding these functions,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.495
overriding them rather so that when I call prints on them,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.640
I can see the value inside the node.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.269
Then these lines of code are just adding

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.130
these nodes as children within this tree where the root node is apple.
