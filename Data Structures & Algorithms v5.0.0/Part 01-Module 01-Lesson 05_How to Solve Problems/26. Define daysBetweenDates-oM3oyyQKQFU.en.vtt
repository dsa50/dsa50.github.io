00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
So now, it's time to see if you can define a days between dates procedure,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.440
that would produce approximate correct results using the current next day procedure.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.585
If we had a correct next day procedure,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.855
your days between dates should produce exactly correct results.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.970
And I am going to suggest one thing as a hint,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.430
doing days between dates by itself is still going to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.980
be more complicated than we want one procedure to be.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.800
So, I'm going to encourage you to start by defining a helper procedure,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.235
and if you're following the problem solving strategy we've set out so far,

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.635
you should test the helper procedure independently

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.465
before you try to build the complete days between dates procedure.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.630
But I'm going to leave it up to you to figure out

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.090
what would be a useful helper procedure, and how to
