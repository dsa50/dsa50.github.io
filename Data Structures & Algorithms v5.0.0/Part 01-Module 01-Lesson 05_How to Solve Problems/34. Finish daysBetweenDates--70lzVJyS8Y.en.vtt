Now, I hope everyone feels confident that

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.990
they can finish days Between Dates on their own.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.465
And so that's the final quiz for this lesson.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.195
So for the answer, we're going to show you how I actually solved this.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.300
I'm going to step through how I would solve

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.970
this and maybe I'll make some mistakes, hopefully I will.

That will make it a lot more interesting.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.525
We'll keep those in the edited answer.

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.099
If you get stuck trying to solve it yourself,

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.765
go ahead and start watching part of the answer.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.690
But then go back to try to solve it yourself after you see how I solved-
