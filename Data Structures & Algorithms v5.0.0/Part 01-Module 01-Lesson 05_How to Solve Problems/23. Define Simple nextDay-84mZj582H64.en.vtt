00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
So for the quiz, your goal's to define the next day procedure

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.370
that takes as input a valid date in the Gregorian calendar,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.045
which is encoded as three numbers;

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:08.745
the year, the month and the day.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:13.290
And then returns the next day as a three tuple of the year, the month and the day.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.797
And to keep this simple,

00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:18.250
you should assume that all months have 30 days.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.015
This of course will not be correct in some cases,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.400
but will be a good start toward solving the
