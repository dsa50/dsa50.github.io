00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.000
A list has all the properties
of a collection.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.710
So it has a group of things but
the objects have an order.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.950
A shopping list, well not really
something programmers do with a lot,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.709
happens to have a lot of the same
properties as the list we use.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.700
There are things that might not
have the same type of object, but

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.939
they're still related to
everything else on the list.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.350
The order doesn't mean much.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.210
It's just the order that I ran out of
each item and there's no fixed length.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.420
I could just keep adding things
to the end, or adding and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.580
removing from the middle and
it doesn't really affect anything.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.660
Again, what exactly
the implementation looks like for

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.100
adding elements will change based on the
language and the type of data structure.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.339
We're still talking theoretically here.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700
So don't sweat the details too much yet.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.910
In this lesson we'll explore
several types of lists.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.819
Different programming languages
treat them differently.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.630
Sometimes a list is incorporated as a
core feature of a programming language,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.190
but what that looks
like can vary wildly.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.690
The videos here will talk about the
theoretical concepts that could apply to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.230
any language,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.910
while the text will explain
the language-specific implementations.
