This new project that I'm in
charge of really has me stumped.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.350
Do you mind if I think out loud for
a bit Winston?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.730
Thanks.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.800
I have a ton of data about websites and
I want to be able to search through them

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
by which pages have links to each other,
there's an issue though.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.489
I can't get a clear mental picture
of what they would look like and

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.726
I don't know which data type is best for
modeling connections between web pages.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.820
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.342
Do you think I should use a graph?

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:30.221
What's that?

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:33.146
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:35.440
Right.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.890
That's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
But I gather a graph is a data structure
designed to show relationships

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.840
between objects.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.870
Sounds great.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.710
I can't wait to learn more.
