00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.910
Another important property
of graphs is connectivity.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.860
That term has a specific meaning in the
study of graphs called Graph Theory but

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
let's define what it means for
a graph to be connected first.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
A disconnected graph has some vertex
that can't be reached by the other

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.640
vertices.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.860
A disconnected graph might have one
vertex off to the side with no edges.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.650
It could also have two
so-called connected components,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.310
which are connected graphs on their own
but have no connection between them.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.930
Thus, a connected graph has
no disconnected vertices.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.290
There's also a metric used to describe
a graph as a whole called connectivity.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.350
Let's look at two different graphs and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.880
say they're each describing
a different group of friends.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.420
When looking at these two graphs,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
the one on the right looks like
a much stronger friend group.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.370
There are overall less people but
more connections between them.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.750
In the left group I could
remove one connection and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.600
the whole group would be destroyed.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.670
This is the principle
behind connectivity,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.610
which measures the minimum number of
elements that need to be removed for

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.960
a graph to become disconnected.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.890
Depending on the information in
the graph, you can sometimes use

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.430
connectivity to answer the question
which graph is stronger.
