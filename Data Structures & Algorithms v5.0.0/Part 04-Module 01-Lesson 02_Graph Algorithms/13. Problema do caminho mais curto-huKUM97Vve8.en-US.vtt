00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.473
Hopefully, you've got used to
straight forward titles in computer

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:04.230
science by now.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.810
If so, you might be able to guess
that the Shortest Path Problem

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.440
is all about finding
the shortest path in a graph.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.990
Early on,
we talked about weighted edges,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.900
where the edges in a graph have some
numeric value associated with them.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.750
The shortest path is the one where
the sum of the edges is as small

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.340
as possible.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.259
If we had an unweighted graph,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.600
the shortest path would just be the one
with the fewest number of edges.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.190
The nature of the solution to this
problem changes a lot depending on

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.949
the type of graph.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.220
For example, the solution to
the Shortest Path Problem for

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.710
an unweighted graph is actually just
a breath first search, with the BFS,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.640
you start at one node and visit
the closest nodes first, slowly moving

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.770
out to more distant nodes until you
find the one that you were looking for.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.710
Again, when there's no weights,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.840
you just want to find the path
with the least number of edges.
